#Book Sort 
##A program to alphabetically sort a library of books by author and genre

This program can be run from the MergeSort.java file. It automatically reads in and sorts my sister's library of books from the booklist.txt file, but this can be adjusted by switching to a new text file with an alternate library. Happy reading!
